          <h2>The Iron Yard</h2>
          <h3>Education | 2017</h3>
          <p>In Spring 2017 I attended the UI Design course offered through The Iron Yard in Raleigh, NC. During the course, I became immersed in design thinking and web design practices. I learned an array of design software and front-end languages including HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Sketch and InVision. The other students and I exercised our knowledge through a number of solo and group projects, culminating in a 3-week-long final project with students from our sister class in Java, building fully-functional web apps based on student proposals.</p>
          <p>Going into the course, I had some explicit goals set out to achieve, namely to introduce myself to the world of web design and to gain a better understanding of design as a broader practice, preparing myself for graduate school and the professional design field. I already had experience with freelance design projects and felt comfortable using static, image-making software but the interactive world of web design was almost completely fresh to me. The UI Design course was an excellent primer and did just what I hoped it would do, giving me a better understanding of what it means to design well.</p>
          <p>Beyond learning the foundations of front-end languages, the course reinforced a concept that is paramount for any designer, that <b>form must follow function</b>. The aesthetic, features and flow of a project are all informed by its use and how it addresses an issue. We developed our understanding of this concept, expanded our creative problem-solving skills, learned new ways to approach idea generation/iteration and tested the value of our ideas through discussion and public speaking.</p>
          <p>Projects ranged from logo design, wireframes, mockups and prototypes of different web and mobile applications, to final projects creating full-featured web apps.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>"Find My Coffee" App</b> | <a href="https://invis.io/6GCJWM0F5"target="_blank">Final Design</a> | Students designed one feature of a mobile app for a coffee retailer. I chose to design for Counter Culture Coffee, creating a semi-interactive mobile app that matches users with appropriate coffee varieties based on their taste preferences.target="blank"</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Goodreads Website</b> | <a href="https://ellisanderson.github.io/goodreadsbookshelf/"target="_blank">Final Design</a> | For this project, students were tasked with redesigning the landing page of the Goodreads website. This was an exercise in taking a preexisting brand, identifying “pain points” within the current user experience and developing a redesign in response to those pain points.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Non-Profit Website</b> | <a href="https://ellisanderson.github.io/nonprofit/"target="_blank">Final Design</a> | Students paired up to redesign a preexisting, local non-profit website of their choice. My partner and I choose to redesign the Durham Arts Council site, having personally used its resources in the past.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Appallitics</b> | <a href="https://appallitics.herokuapp.com/"target="_blank">Final Project</a> | Collaborating with a team of Java developers, I was responsible for the UI design and front-end implementation of <em>Appallitics</em>, a satirical web app that allows users to create their own dictatorship and compete against other candidates for the most votes.</p>

          <h2>Elsewhere Museum</h2>
          <h3>Freelance | 2016</h3>
          <p><a href="http://www.goelsewhere.org/" target="_blank">Elsewhere Museum</a> is an artist residency and self-described "Living Museum" set within a former thrift store, in downtown Greensboro, NC. Elsewhere invites artists from around the world to utilize the "collection," reusing and reinterpreting the materials to create new and constantly evolving work. I had the pleasure of working with their team to design the 2016/2017 Museum/Residency Brochure.</p>
          <p>From initial discussions with the museum director, we set a number of goals to be implemented in the design. Our primary goal was to have visitors take the brochure and keep it in plain sight on a regular basis as a reminder and reference for upcoming events. The brochure was made to be an arts-object itself, encouraging visitors to pin the flyer to refridgerators, walls or bulletin boards around Greensboro.</p>
          <p>The visual imagery, color pallette and organizational structure of the brochure all reference the museum's physical space. Much like the real-world experience of being in the museum, the brochure brims with content. The final design is folded in eighths and is viewable as either a booklet or a two-sided poster.</p>

          <h2>Third Uncle Records</h2>
          <h3>Freelance | 2016</h3>
          <p>Based out of Indianapolis, IN, Third Uncle Records has released multiple projects from No One Mind in 2016. Serving dual roles as visual artist and musician, I've had the opportunity to craft design and illustration that closely match the sonic and emotional character of the music.</p>
          <p>Partnering with the label in this way, where I'm able to assume an array of roles across media has become one of the most satisfying experiences of my creative career. Here I'm able to both develop my multi-disciplinary approach to art-making and represent the material through a unified brand.</p>
